# MS-CAIS: Multi-Sensor Culvert Autonomous Inspection System
**The effective operation of civil infrastructure is crucial for economic stability. To ensure continued performance, regular maintenance is essential. However, underground infrastructure, like culverts and tunnels, posed more significant challenges in managing and preserving these critical assets such as maneuverability and danger,  slow labor-intensive, defect localization, and superficial assessment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective solution for infrastructure inspection through the development of MS-CAIS, a Multi-Sensor (MS) Culvert Autonomous Inspection System. Our solution integrates multiple vision cameras, a densed LiDAR, a deep learning based defect segmentation system, lighting systems, and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods for a comprehensive condition assessment. In addition, we integrate a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to find and assess defect areas in confined and unstructured underground environments. Furthermore, we provide an open-source implementation of our framework on GitHub.**
